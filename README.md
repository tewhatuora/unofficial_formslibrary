# unofficial_formslibrary
This is where FHIR Questionnaires (ie. forms) can be published that are in use by hospitals and other services in Te Whatu Ora.

These forms are buyer beware - you should provide information about who uses the form and why. What information is pre-populated, and whether there are any calculations in the form. Screenshots of the user interface would be useful. In general we want to organise by use case at the top level (rather than location).

This should reflect questionnaires that are published with the relevant profile here: https://fhir-ig.digital.health.nz/

Library includes:

Canshare Breast Pathology.json - for registering breast cancer cases (Owner: Te Aho o Te Kahu - contact: John Fountain)
