***Purpose***

The Ministry of Health’s investment in new medicines and increased transplant capacity has created additional demand for timely, accurate data. 

These forms:

1. Waiting List registration - allows new patients to be added to the waiting list
2. Waiting List update - allows patients on the waiting list to be updated.
3. Treatment planning - allows patients who are waiting to get their care scheduled
4. Treatment finalisation - allows the service to close out the transplant episode

**Business Rules**

1. Patients shouldn't have multiple simultaneous registrations, but can have sequential registrations.
2. Patients shouldn't have form 2, 3, or 4 without 1.
3. Patients may not have or need forms 2 or 3.
